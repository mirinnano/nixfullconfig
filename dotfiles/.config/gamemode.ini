[general]
; GameMode Configuration
; https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode

; The reaper thread will check every 5 seconds for exited clients
reaper_freq=5

; The desired governor is used when entering GameMode
; instead of "performance"
desiredgov=performance

; The default governor is used when leaving GameMode
defaultgov=powersave

; The iGPU desired governor is used when the integrated GPU is under heavy load
igpu_desiredgov=performance

; The iGPU default governor is used when the integrated GPU is not under heavy load
igpu_defaultgov=powersave

; GameMode can change the scheduler policy to SCHED_ISO for game threads
; This can help with reducing latency and improving performance
; 0 = off, 1 = on
softrealtime=1

; GameMode can adjust the nice level of clients to give them scheduling priority
; -20 is highest priority, 0 is default, 19 is lowest priority
renice=10

; GameMode can adjust process scheduling
; SCHED_ISO is a soft real-time policy
ioprio=0

; Inhibit the screensaver when GameMode is active
inhibit_screensaver=1

[filter]
; If "whitelist" entry has a value(s)
; gamemode will reject anything not in the whitelist
;whitelist=RiseOfTheTombRaider

; Gamemode will always reject anything in the blacklist
;blacklist=HalfLife3

[gpu]
; Use AMD GPU performance levels (requires sysfs support)
apply_gpu_optimisations=accept_responsibility
gpu_device=0

; Set AMD GPU power profile
; Profiles: auto, low, high, manual, default
amd_performance_level=high

[custom]
; Custom scripts can be run on gamemode start and end
; start=notify-send "GameMode started"
; end=notify-send "GameMode ended"

; Custom scripts can be run per game
; The game name is matched with the executable name
;start=./scripts/gamemode_start.sh
;end=./scripts/gamemode_end.sh

[supervisor]
; Supervisor can automatically start/stop services when gamemode is active
supervisor_disable=false

; Supervisor will check every 5 seconds for exited clients
supervisor_freq=5

[cpu]
; CPU frequency governor scaling for gamemode
; park_cores=no
pin_threads=yes
